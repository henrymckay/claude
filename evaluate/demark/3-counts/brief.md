# Counts brief

Carry on from the candles tool.
Now I want DeMark counts over those candles, which is the thing the tool exists for.

## Counts

Three counts for every candle, on every timeframe.

### Setup

Compare each candle's close to the close four candles earlier.

- A **sell setup** is a run of consecutive candles each closing *higher* than the close four candles before it.
- A **buy setup** is a run each closing *lower*.

Only one can be active at a time, and the run resets the moment a candle breaks it.
Report the length of the run active on the candle in question.
It runs 1 to 9 and then wraps back to 1.

### Sequential

The countdown that follows a completed setup.
Compare each candle's close to the **high or low two candles earlier**.

- A **sell** countdown counts candles closing at or above the high two candles before them.
- A **buy** countdown counts candles closing at or below the low two candles before them.

Qualifying candles need not be consecutive.
The countdown runs to 13.

It can also be cut short before it gets there, and I want all three ways that happens.

- A setup completes in the opposite direction.
- The same setup recycles, meaning another setup completes in the same direction, and the new one replaces the countdown in progress.
- The setup's own true range is broken, meaning a later candle trades beyond the extreme of the nine candles that made the setup, against the direction the countdown is pointing.

### Combo

The same countdown rule, except counting begins with the setup rather than waiting for it to complete.
Also runs to 13, and is cut short the same three ways.

## Notation

Buy counts are positive and sell counts negative, on one continuum that wraps buy to sell to buy.
A single number then carries both the direction and how far along the count is, so one pair of bounds picks out either end.

Zero sits in the middle and means nothing is running, whether that is no setup on the candle or no countdown open.
A countdown that reaches 13 is finished, so the candles after it read zero until the next one opens.

## Output

One row per ticker, timeframe and date, carrying the three counts.
The same two ways as before, to standard output for piping and to a file I name.

## Commands

- Report all three counts together.
- Report one count on its own, with a command each for setup, sequential and combo.

## Working style

Keep going in the same repository, and let its structure change as this rung earns it.

Invoke and follow your skills throughout, for setting the project up, writing the code and testing it.
**Don't draw on anything in your saved memory; work only from your skills.**
Where a skill is silent, ambiguous or steers you wrong, note it as you go rather than quietly working around it.

Write it in a functional style.
